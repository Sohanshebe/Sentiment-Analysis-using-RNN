# Sentiment Analysis using RNN

## Project Overview
Sentiment Analysis using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is a natural language processing (NLP) project aimed at analyzing the sentiment of textual data. This project employs RNNs, a type of deep learning algorithm well-suited for sequence data, to classify the sentiment of text into positive, negative, or neutral categories.

Sentiment analysis has numerous applications across various industries, including social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, product review analysis, and market research. By automatically categorizing text into sentiment classes, businesses and organizations can gain valuable insights into customer opinions and sentiments.

## How it Works
The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: The project utilizes a dataset of text reviews, such as movie reviews or product reviews. This dataset is preprocessed to clean the text, remove noise, and prepare it for training.

2. **Model Training**: The cleaned text data is used to train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model. The RNN model learns to analyze the sequential nature of text data and make predictions about the sentiment of the text.

3. **Model Evaluation**: Once trained, the model is evaluated on a separate dataset to assess its performance and accuracy in sentiment classification.

4. **Inference**: After successful training and evaluation, the trained model can be used to perform sentiment analysis on new, unseen text data. This allows users to classify the sentiment of text in real-time or on large volumes of data.
